    I'm Milton Pereira, a seasoned QA Leader and ISTQB-certified Senior Quality Assurance Engineer with over 15 years of experience in regulated and fast-paced environments. My passion lies in ensuring software quality across complex systems, with a strong emphasis on automation, agile practices, and user-centric testing.

    Throughout my career, I've led QA teams across the globe, built scalable test frameworks, and championed quality-first mindsets in organizations like Palladium Digital and Srijan Technologies. My hands-on experience ranges from AI testing with GPT platforms to performance and security testing using tools like Cypress, JMeter, OWASP ZAP, and Postman.
